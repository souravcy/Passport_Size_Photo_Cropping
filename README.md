# Passport_Size_Photo_Cropping
Using OpenCV face recognition to detect face from a picture and crop passport size photo for that face. The passport size photo is calculated from the face detected using simple mathematical calculations.

The project involves:
1. Detecting the face from the pictures inside the original folder.
2. Cutting a frame of passport photo size around that face.
3. Saving the cropped pic in a cropped folder. If face is not detected then saving it in not detected folder.
